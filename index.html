        This map gives a detailed view of where Wisconsin voters are and
        who they voted for in the 2014 election for governor&mdash;the most 
        recent election with widespread voter turnout.
        In this election, Republican Scott Walker won over 
        Democrat Mary Burke, with Walker taking 52% of the
        votes compared to Burke's 47%.

        Of Wisconsin's 4.3 million eligible voters, roughly 2.4 million 
        went to the 
        polls in this election. This level of voter turnout is
        comparable to that of the last election for president in 2012 
        and dwarfs the turnout of the two most recent Spring elections in
        which less that a million voters went to the polls.

        Milwaukee and its suburbs represent roughly a quarter of the state's 
        eligible voters. It is also one of the most racially 
        segregated cities in 
        United States. The Democrat-Republican divide closely follows the 
        racial divide of the city. The urban center of the city represents 
        one-fifth of all Democrats in the state, while the surrounding suburbs
        represent roughly one-fifth of all Republicans. 
        Voter turnout also differs sharply between urban and suburban Milwaukee. 
        While just over half of eligible urban voters cast a vote, 
        over two-thirds of eligible suburban voters went to the polls.

        Wisconsin's capital and second largest city, Madison, is a
        stronghold for Democrats. Dane county,
        the encompassing county of Madison, represents over 15% of the state's
        Democrats and had the second highest Democrat-voting percentage behind 
        the Menominee Indian Reservation.
